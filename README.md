# Game of Quests Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the development and testing of a text-based game, implemented over three assignments. Each branch corresponds to a specific assignment and demonstrates progressive enhancements in implementation and testing strategies.

## Branches and Assignments

### Assignment 1 (`JUnit`) - Initial Text-Based Game Implementation

- Builds on top of Assignment 1 while introducing behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Cucumber.
- Implements reusable **‘Given’** and **‘When’** steps to enhance test flexibility.
- Focuses on test data creation challenges to make acceptance tests executable.

### Assignment 2 (`Cucumber`) - Acceptance Testing with Cucumber

- Builds on top of A1 while introducing behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Cucumber.
- Implemented reusable ‘Given’ and ‘When’ steps to enhance test flexibility.

### Assignment 3 (`Selenium`) - Web-Based Implementation and Selenium Testing

- Transforms the game into a web-based version.
- Uses Selenium to automate and drive the four acceptance test scenarios created in A2.
- Focuses on web UI interactions and end-to-end system validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core game logic  
- **JUnit** – Unit testing  
- **Cucumber** – Behavior-driven testing  
- **Selenium** – Web UI testing  
- **GitHub** – Version control and branching strategy
